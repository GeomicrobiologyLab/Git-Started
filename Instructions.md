# INSTRUCTIONS FOR GETTING __GITHUB__ STARTED
 Feb 9th 2018, REW

(I am using markdown formatting in the BBEdit application)

## 1. Make a user on GitHub
This will allow you to access GitHub


## 2. Sign up as an educator
[click here to sign up as an educator/student](https://education.github.com)
This will allow us to create private repositories and share private repositories with each other.

## 3. Click Dr. Reese's email to view the Geomicrobiology repository
This gives you access to shared files
	
	
## 4. Download the github desktop application
This will create a folder in your documents folder called Github.
This is where all of your files will be.

## 5. How to change files on your laptop and _push_ them to the online repository
Once the GitHub desktop file is downloaded, sign in.
